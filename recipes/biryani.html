    <p>
      Biryani is a vibrantly flavored rice dish popular across South Asia. It
      features aromatic basmati rice cooked with meat (chicken, lamb, goat,
      etc.), vegetables, and a warm blend of spices. The ingredients are often
      layered and steamed together, resulting in a dish with distinct textures
      and rich flavors. Biryani is a celebratory food, enjoyed at weddings,
      festivals, and family gatherings.

        Marinate the Chicken: Combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice,
        spices, and herbs. Coat the chicken pieces and marinate for at least 30
        minutes, or ideally, overnight in the refrigerator for maximum flavor.

        Prepare the Rice: Rinse and soak the basmati rice for 30 minutes. In a
        separate pot, heat ghee or oil, add cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and fry
        briefly. Add the soaked rice, water or chicken stock (optional), and
        salt. Cook partially (around 70% done) and drain.

        Cook the Chicken: In another pot, heat oil and fry onions until golden
        brown. Add the marinated chicken and cook until browned. You can add
        some water or yogurt to create a gravy if desired.
      </li>

        Assemble and Layer: In a large pot or baking dish, spread a layer of
        cooked rice. Top it with half the cooked chicken, fried onions
        (optional), and some fresh coriander leaves (optional). Repeat with
        another layer of rice, remaining chicken, and fried onions.
      </li>

        Steam and Finish: Sprinkle saffron water (soaked saffron strands in hot
        water) or kewra water (optional) over the top. Seal the pot tightly with
        foil or a lid. Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is
        fully cooked and fluffy. pen_spark
